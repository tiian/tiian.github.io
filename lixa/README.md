# LIXA - LIbre XA

LIXA is a free and open source implementation of standard XA and TX 
specifications; furthermore LIXA ships XTA, [**XA Transaction API**](XTA.md),
a new transactional API for applications.

## Documentation
Here is the last version of the LIXA manual as an HTML document:

- [multiple pages](/lixa/manuals/html/index.html)
- [single page](/lixa/manuals/html/index_all_in_one.html)

## API
XTA API Reference is available for the following programming languages:

- [C](/lixa/manuals/xta/C/index.html)
- [C++](/lixa/manuals/xta/CPP/index.html), it's useful even for Python
- [Java](/lixa/manuals/xta/Java/index.html)

For the API provided by the TX Transaction Demarcation specification refer to
the [official Technical Standard](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9694999599/toc.pdf); LIXA support the TX standard for both [C](https://www.tiian.org/lixa/manuals/html/ch05.html) and [COBOL](https://www.tiian.org/lixa/manuals/html/ch06.html) programming languages.

## Download
Main hosting site is [GitHub](https://github.com/tiian/lixa), alternative hosting site is [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lixa/).

## Docker Images
Docker images are available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/lixa): here you can find ready to use and base images to develop XTA applications that run in Docker containers.

## Performances
Are you scared about [performances](performances/performances.md) of Distributed Transactions? LIXA might surprise you! If you are interested in the topic, don't miss this section with the results that have been obtained with a [colocated/sidecar architecture](performances/performances_2.md).
