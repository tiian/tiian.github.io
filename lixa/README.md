# LIXA - LIbre XA

LIXA is a free and open source implementation of XA and TX specifications.

LIXA ships XTA, [**XA Transaction API**](XTA.md), a new transactional API for
applications.

Here is the last version of the LIXA manual as an HTML document:

- [multiple pages](/manuals/html/index.html)
- [single page](/manuals/html/index_all_in_one.html)

XTA API Reference is available for the following programming languages:

- [C](/manuals/xta/C/index.html)
- [C++](/manuals/xta/CPP/index.html), it's useful even for Python
- [Java](/manuals/xta/Java/index.html)

Main hosting site is [GitHub](https://github.com/tiian/lixa), alternative hosting site is [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lixa/).

Docker images are available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/lixa): here you can find ready to use and base images to develop XTA applications that run in Docker containers.

LIXA articles:

- [Microservices and Distributed Transactions](https://dzone.com/articles/microservices-and-distributed-transactions): introduces how LIXA and XTA supports microservices based architectures

Legacy [home page](https://sourceforge.net/p/lixa/wiki/) still contains interesting contents that will be gradually migrated to this new site.
