# tiian.org

tiian.org is my personal open and free software initiative; it hosts 3 projects:

- [LIXA](/lixa), LIbre XA, a free and open source XA transaction manager
- [FLoM](/flom), a Free Lock Manager with command line and API
- [LIBJF](http://libjf.sourceforge.net), LIBrary for Journaled Files

LIXA is the largest project and still in evolution, FLoM can be considered a stable project and LIBJF is a quite old project that I have not touched since many years.
