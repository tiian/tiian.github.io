# Perl API bindings
Perl5 API bindings were contributed to the project by Kevin L. Esteb.     
Basic usage examples are available in directory "doc/examples/perl":

* [basic.pl](https://github.com/tiian/flom/blob/master/doc/examples/perl/basic.pl)
* [advanced.pl](https://github.com/tiian/flom/blob/master/doc/examples/perl/advanced.pl)
* [transactional.pl](https://github.com/tiian/flom/blob/master/doc/examples/perl/transactional.pl)

Even the test case programs can be used as examples. They can be retrieved from directory "tests/src":

* [case5000.pl](https://github.com/tiian/flom/blob/master/tests/src/case5000.pl)
* [case5001.pl](https://github.com/tiian/flom/blob/master/tests/src/case5001.pl)
* [case5002.pl](https://github.com/tiian/flom/blob/master/tests/src/case5002.pl)
