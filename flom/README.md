# This page is the root of wiki documentation #

An overview article was published by [DZone](https://dzone.com/articles/flom-the-free-lock-manager) and is available in a [printer friendly format here](http://flom.sourceforge.net/FLoM%20overview.pdf).

A step by step tutorial is available in wiki format here: [FLoM by examples]

Are you asking yourself because I started to develop this software? Are you tired to write cryptic shell scripts to manage locking and synchronization? [Read the tale]

As you can imagine this is not the first time some one is trying to give you a tool like this. This page collects some [Similar tools] I discovered googling around.

## If you was not annoyed by the previous stuff, you might be interested in some more detailed documentation... ##

FLoM runs around the [Resource] concept: take a look to it.

FLoM is distributed as C source code you may download, compile and install using standard git and GNU build chain (automake, autoconf, gcc): [installation].

FLoM wants to be **just work software** and configuration should be reduced to the minimum: this page gives you some hint to explore [Configuration] matter.

[FLoM deep diving] contains specific detailed topics you could interested in after you tried some examples (use cases).

## FLoM API (Application Programming Interface) ##
Starging with version 0.9.0 FLoM provides an API based on [libflom] that's compiled and installed using libtool; using **libflom** you can use a FLoM *daemon* to synchronize your own applications and your own shell scripts/commands using the **same** tool.

The FLoM API allows you to write your own program using these programming languages:

* C: primary interface
* C++: header only wrapper based on C primary interface
* Java: wrapper based on C primary interface (JNI implementation)
* Perl: wrapper based on C primary interface and generated by [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/)
* PHP: wrapper based on C primary interface and generated by [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/)
* Python: wrapper based on C primary interface and generated by [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/)

## FLoM Security ##
SSL/TLS [Security] allows to protect network communications and enable peer to peer mutual authentication based on X.509 certificates.

## FLoM IoT Gateway Component ##
Take a look to the project [roadmap] and vote the preferred features.

## Your feedback is very valuable... ##
Don't esitate to write your suggestions using the [project forum](http://sourceforge.net/p/flom/discussion/): without your feedback this software can't become terribly useful.

## GitHub ##
FLoM is available on GitHub too: https://github.com/tiian/flom
